Abstract:

From level ground, human vision is limited to immediate surroundings. For a broader scope of view, humans require a higher vantage point. However, a greater distance sacrifices accuracy. Humans need to efficiently and accurately place objects over large target areas for various tasks such as agricultural mass-seeding, combating wildfires, or marine surface surveillance. To expand human vision for wide-range object placement, the project is a stationary machine designed to autonomously detect a container from an aerial view and complete a simple task: launch a marble into the container. The machine searches for the container with machine learning then estimates the distance from the container and finally calculates the angle to launch the marble. The machine begins centered 25 cm away from the edge of a 1.0 by 0.5m area. The machine detects a 14.2 cm tall container with a 9 cm diameter placed at a random location within the defined area. When the machine locates the container, the machine orientates to launch a 14mm diameter marble into the container. After ten trials, the machine achieved a 90% success rate of landing the marble in the container. Improvements include a more consistent launch mechanism or a more efficient detection model to increase application. Future experimentation includes a larger area or varying targets to further challenge the machine. Ultimately, features of the current machine functioned as intended and could be implemented in more extensive real-world projects.
